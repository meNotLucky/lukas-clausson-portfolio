It’s the 1950’s and you play as a female trapped in a surreal house. You are on a quest of trying to find a way out. However, the house would rather see you dead than free.",
        "p2" : "Happy Homemaker was developed over the course of three months, but due to outside work most of the actual game was created over only two weeks. It was displayed at <a href='https://itch.io/jam/gotland-game-conference-2020/rate/639941' target='blank'>GGC 2020</a>."

Great job! :) Would love to experience more in the world!” <br><br> “Great 3D graphic and style that sets the mood of the game directy. The animations of the character and radio was vivid and smooth.",
